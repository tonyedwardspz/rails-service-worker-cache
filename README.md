# rails_service_worker_cache gem

NOT FOR PUBLIC USE YET. ACTIVE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT IS IN PROGRESS.

A drop in solution for rails to cache versioned assets on the client using service workers.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem "rails_service_worker_cache", '~> 0.1.0', :git => "git@github.com:tonyedwardspz/rails-service-worker-cache.git"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rails_service_worker_cache

## Usage

TODO: Improve this

Add some configuration lovelyness.

## Versioning

Semantic versioning (http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) is used.

For a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, unless MAJOR is 0:

1. MAJOR version is incremented when incompatible API changes are made,
2. MINOR version is incremented when functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner,
3. PATCH version is incremented when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made.

Major version "zero" (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time.
The public API should not be considered stable.

## Dependencies

If you're add this to a rails `4.*` project, you have everything you need.
