## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Versioning

Semantic versioning (http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) is used. 

For a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, unless MAJOR is 0:

1. MAJOR version is incremented when incompatible API changes are made,
2. MINOR version is incremented when functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner, 
3. PATCH version is incremented when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made.

Major version "zero" (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. 
The public API should not be considered stable. 
Furthermore, version "double-zero" (0.0.x) is not intended for public use, 
as even minimal functionality is not guaranteed to be implemented yet.
